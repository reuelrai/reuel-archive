        For a few hours, it’s your trust.
        For a few weeks, it’s your friendship.
        But to wait when you know the person will not come — that is your love.

        People say you should never expect anything in return from anyone. But the truth is, when we truly love someone, we naturally expect a little care and love in return.

        Everyone you meet is part of your journey, but not all of them are meant to stay in your life. Some people are just passing through to bring you gifts — either blessings or lessons.
        And in this journey, you must learn to appreciate the transient nature of relationships, understanding that each encounter has its purpose:
        to shape your character, teach you resilience, and prepare you for the deeper connections that lie ahead`
