As I was rushing home to get it, I saw a girl getting into an accident near the exit of the airport. It seemed like she had been hit by a car and was lying on the road. I raised my hand, stopped the incoming traffic, and helped her. Though it wasnâ€™t too severe, her leg had taken some damage. I took care of her, and later she came to my house. We spent a few moments together. She had a round face, light skin, and beautiful eyes.`,
