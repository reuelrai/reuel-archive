            `Over your lifetime, you will meet many people.
                You will never know when that last time is—
                the last time you laugh together,
                the last time you see their smile,
                the last message left on read.
        
                People drift, disappear, or change,
                sometimes without warning, sometimes without reason.
                But every connection leaves a trace—
                a memory, a lesson, a scar, or a soft spot in your heart.
        
                So speak kindly, forgive,
                and hold the ones you love a little longer.
                Because every moment could be the last,
                and some goodbyes never get said aloud.`,

        description:
            `Life is like a train station.
            People come and go.
            Some stay for a few stops,
            some ride with you for miles,
            some leave before you’re ready to say goodbye.
        
            But every person teaches you something,
            even if they’re not meant to stay forever.
        
            The key is knowing when to hold on,
            and when to let them catch their next train—
            because not everyone is on the same journey,
            and that’s okay.`,
